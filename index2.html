			<h4>BE 1600 - Introduction to Programming and Computation: Python</h4>
			<p>An introduction to programming using Python for students with no programming experience. 
			Basic control structures (sequence, selection, repetition) and all core data types using objects. 
			Practice on core data structures (string, list, tuple, dictionary, and set). 
			Design, implementation and testing of programs to solve problems with an emphasis on data manipulation using real world, practical examples.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Noteworthy Project:
					<ul>

					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>CSC 1100 - Problem Solving and Programming: C++</h4>
			<p>Problem solving with algorithms, and their realization as computer programs using a structured, general purpose programming language; 
			data types, operators, expressions, assignment, input and output, selection and repetition control structures; modularity and procedural abstraction 
			using functions with parameters; structured data types, arrays, pointers and strings.</p>

				</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h4>CSC 1500 - Fundamental Structures in Computer Science: C++</h4>
			<p>Introduction to fundamental control and data structures in computer science such as algorithms and complexity; 
			recursive algorithms; program correctness using the predicate calculus; reasoning about algorithms using mathematical induction; 
			divide and conquer algorithms; recurrence relations; set properties and their computation; and computing with relations. 
			Graph properties and their computation, and tree properties and their computation, will be covered if time permits. </p>
